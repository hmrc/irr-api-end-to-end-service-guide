## Overview
<!-- Section owner: IRR Programme -->

This guide explains how you can use the Interest Restriction Return API with your software

It is written for software developers, designers, analysts, managers and others involved with creating or integrating software that connects to this API.

The API supports the following functions:

* Revoke an existing Reporting Company from submitting Interest Restriction Returns
* Appoint a new Reporting Company for submitting Interest Restriction Returns
* Submit an Interest Restriction Return (full)
* Submit an Interest Restriction Return (abbreviated)

For more information about how to develop your own client applications, including example clients for this API, see [Tutorials](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/tutorials).

## User restricted endpoints

This application uses user restricted endpoints. This means that we require specific authorisation from the user to grant authority to your application to interact with HMRC on their behalf, without sharing their access credentials.

For in depth information about user restricted endpoints, together with examples on how to integrate with them, please visit HMRCâ€™s developer hub guidance on [User Restricted Endpoints](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/authorisation/user-restricted-endpoints)
